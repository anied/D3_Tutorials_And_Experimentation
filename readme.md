#D3 Tutorials And Experimentation

Just a repo to store various tests, tutorials and other code while learning D3.  Not really intended for public consumption, but feel free to poke around if you're so inclined.

## Setup
Install node packages:
`npm install`

Install bower packages:
`bower install`

## Run
`npm start` then navigate to the [`http://localhost:8080/`](http://localhost:8080/) (I'm just using defaults here at the moment) and prepare to behold some pretty basic tutorials I've been working on.
